# Keyboard App!

## Purpose

This plays a sound whenever a key is pressed - that's it.
Sounds are NOT provided (although you can upload as many as you want and choose a default)

## How to use

1. Navigate to `Releases` and download `publish.zip` for v0.1.0
2. Make sure you have `.NET 8.0` and above installed (Windows should have this by default)
3. Unzip it and run `KeyboardSoundApp.exe`
4. Select a sound, pick a default, then close the app (it will minimize to the Tray)
5. Enjoy!

## Notes
- Most audio file formats should be supported
